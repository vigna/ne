(This file, CHANGES, lists fixes. See NEWS for new features and enhancements.)

Unreleased

  * Fixed possible crash when closing documents from within the SelectDoc
    requester.

  * Fixed adjusted position of mark, bookmark on same line as and to the right
    of multi-line pastes.

3.2.1 2019-10-02

  * Fixed reordering items on multi-page requesters.

3.2.0 2019-09-30

  * Fixed typo for "Home" key in default.keys.

  * Add backtick support for MarkDown syntax (md.jsf)

  * Fixed potentially infinite backwards search-and-replace.

3.1.2 2018-10-06

  * Fixed visual glitch when characters spanning multiple columns are only
    partially displayed on the left side.

  * Fixed PARAGRAPH command.

  * DeleteNextWord now deletes through the end of the next N words.

  * Undoing DeleteNextWord/DeletePrevWord also restores cursor position.

3.1.1 2017-06-04

  * Fixed visual glitch when deleting characters from long lines.

  * Fixed broken behavior in WordWrap with leading whitespace.

  * On CloseDoc (^Q), the next document now becomes active. It used to make
    the previous document active.

3.1.0 2017-04-29

  * Comments in .yaml files are highlighted more correctly.

  * Determine better whether Find and FindRegExp patterns need to be recompiled
    when switching buffers. Fix possible lockup after cancelled Find.

  * Fixed missing screen update after ABOUT (regression introduced in 3.0.1).
    Thanks to Brian Callahan for reporting this bug.

  * Help command uses its optional parameter again.

  * PasteVert behaves beyond the right end of lines again.

  * AutoComplete keeps words containing apostrophes as single words ("can't"
    instead of "can" and "t").

  * Home, End, Tab keys now work in menus.

  * Backward FindRegExp works again.

  * Resizing the window in inputs, requesters is more sane.

  * Restored correct keyboard input for 8-bit character sets.

  * Update syntax code for feature parity with current Joe.

3.0.1 2015-06-22

  * Updated version of GNU regex library provides 64-bit regular
    expressions.

  * We no longer assign stdin, fixing a *BSD compatibility problem (thanks
    to Brian Callahan for reporting this issue).

  * Fixed missing screen update at startup when no default autoprefs are
    available.

3.0  2015-06-18

  * Allow remapping of character SEQuences in .keys files.

  * Global macros are now loaded from NE_GLOBAL_DIR/macros rather than
    NE_GLOBAL_DIR (/usr/local/share/ne/macros vs /usr/local/share/ne).

2.6  2015-04-17

  * Ancient bug with vertical clip edges fixed.

  * AutoComplete occasionally would omit some completions.

  * Exit attempts to save all modified documents even if one cannot be saved.
    (It used to give up on the first error.)

  * Avoid crash when resizing window while command prompt is active.

  * Avoid SaveMacro optimization before Undo, called macros.

2.5  2012-12-24

  * Pathologically long-running PARAGRAPH commands are now stoppable (^-\).

  * Moved modified flag '*' to right end of status line to be easier to see.

  * COPY, CUT, ERASE copy the correct text to the clip and do not crash
    any more when in free form mode and cursor or mark is beyond the
    end of a line.

  * ReplaceOnce was returning a generic error code instead of success,
    thus stopping macros.

2.4  2012-04-10

  * CLOSEDOC and QUIT (^Q and Alt-Q) now close string requesters just like Esc.

  * Macro calling macros are now stopped at an arbitrary depth of 32 calls.

  * Last command of a loaded macro w/o trailing new-line now works.

  * Vertical block selections where mark is below cursor select correct text.

  * Mark right of a tab no longer moves when you change tab size.

  * MARK and MARKVERT with no parameters always set rather than toggle the mark.

  * Cursor no longer goes to start of line when you change tab size.

  * A couple of operations in free form mode (joining the first line with
    the following one and deleting a block with an extreme beyond the end
    of file) should not cause crashes anymore.

  * AUTOCOMPLETE could sometimes insert an inadvertent trailing "*".

2.3  2011-10-28

  * Fixed ridiculously old bug when copying a block and the marker is
    after the cursor.

  * Tweak to syntax file for java.

  * Changed build date in "About" to ISO YYYY-MM-DD format.

  * Tweak suspend to signal process group; reduce chance of apparent hang.

  * Instantaneous window resize works again.

  * Now we display an error message (instead of crashing or returning an
    I/O error) when a file is too large (>=2GiB).

  * We no longer set the buffer filename in case of I/O error.

2.2  2011-01-23

  * Fixed memory allocation macros in regex code from glibc to work on systems
    that return NULL on zero-sized allocations.

  * In makefile, made explicit the dependencies for regex.o.

  * Fixed bug in "AdjustView R" that could push current character off screen.

  * Ensure tab size remains less than half the window width when the window
    changes size.

  * Fixed buggy out-of-memory handling when loading files.

  * Fixed buggy HTML/CSS syntax highlighting.

  * Fixed wrong background line colour when clearing to the end of line.

  * ToUpper and ToLower now stop when they reach the end of a document.

2.1  2010-03-17

  * Fixed efficiency bug introduced with syntax highlighting: ne should now
    be much more responsive along slow connections.

  * Fixed old, bad, shameful bug: complex assertions were compiled into
    the code even for the non-debug version. As a result, ne was deadly
    slow on large files.

  * Fixed small mistakes in the keyboard sequences displayed in the menus,
    and small discrepancies between default.keys/default.menus and reality
    (thanks to John Gabriele for having pointed out this).

  * In some cases after a keyboard timeout an ESC character was left in
    the keyboard buffer, causing weird behaviours.

  * Probably really (this time) fixed problems with regexps matching empty strings.

  * BackSpace and Delete behave better in FreeForm mode.
