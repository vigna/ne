/* These functions provide basic management of lists. The basic ideas in this
   file come from the Amiga Exec list management functions and their C
   counterparts developed by Marco Zandonadi. Note that because of the way a
   list is defined, there are never special cases for the empty list. The price
   to pay is that a list is empty not if it's NULL, but rather is l->head->next
   is NULL. The first node of a list is l->head, the last one is
   l->tail_pred. A node is the last in a list if n->next->next == NULL. */
