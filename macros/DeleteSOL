# This example macro implements a "Delete to Start-of-line"
# command which you can map to a key of your choice. If I
# chose to use the Alt-U key, for example, then first I use
# the KeyCode command to find the ne key number for that key
# combination. On my system, it's 1f5, which is currently
# mapped to the "U" command shortcut for "UNDO". To map it to
# this DeleteSOL macro instead, I would put these lines:
#
#    # Let Alt-U map to the DeleteSOL macro
#    KEY 1f5 DeleteSOL
# 
# in my ~/.ne/.keys file. The first line is just a comment.
#
# Note that while the case of the "KEY" keyword and keycode
# itself don't matter (you could spell it "Key 1F5" or "key
# 1f5" or even "kEY 1F5"), and the case of built-in ne
# commands don't matter either, the case of macro names does
# matter, as these must match file names.
