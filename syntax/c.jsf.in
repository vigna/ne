# JOE syntax highlight file for C and C++

# A (deterministic) state machine which performs lexical analysis of C.
# (This is the "assembly language" of syntax highlighting.  A separate
# program could be used to convert a regular expression NFA syntax into this
# format).

# Each state begins with ':<name> <color-name>'
# <color-name> is the color used for characters eaten by the state
# (really a symbol for a user definable color).

# The first state defined is the initial state.

# Within a state, define transitions (jumps) to other states.  Each
# jump has the form: <character-list> <target-state> [<option>s]

# There are three ways to specify <character-list>s, either * for any
# character not otherwise specified, & to match the character in the
# delimiter match buffer or a literal list of characters within quotes
# (ranges and escape sequences allowed).  When the next character matches
# any in the list, a jump to the target-state is taken and the character is
# eaten (we advance to the next character of the file to be colored).
#
# The * transition should be the first transition specified in the state.
#
# There are several options:
#   noeat     	do not eat the character, instead feed it to the next state
#             	(this tends to make the states smaller, but be careful: you
#		can make infinite loops).  'noeat' implies 'recolor=-1'.
#
#   recolor=-N	Recolor the past N characters with the color of the
#		target-state.  For example once /* is recognized as the
#		start of C comment, you want to color the /* with the C
#		comment color with recolor=-2.
#
#   mark	Mark beginning of a region with current position.
#
#   markend	Mark end of region.
#
#   recolormark Recolor all of the characters in the marked region with
#               the color of the target-state.  If markend is not given,
#		all of the characters up to the current position are recolored.
#		Note that the marked region can not cross line boundaries and
#               must be on the same line as recolormark.
#
#   buffer    	start copying characters to a string buffer, beginning with this
#		one (it's ok to not terminate buffering with a matching
#		'strings' option- the buffer is limited to leading 23
#		characters).
#
#   save_c      Save character in delimiter match buffer.
#
#   save_s      Copy string buffer to delimiter match buffer.
#
#   strings	A list of strings follows.  If the buffer matches any of the
#		given strings, a jump to the target-state in the string list
#		is taken instead of the normal jump.
#
#   istrings	Same as strings, but case is ignored.
#
#               Note: strings and istrings should be the last option on the
#		line.  They cause any options which follow them to be ignored.
#
#   hold        Stop buffering string- a future 'strings' or 'istrings' will
#               look at contents of buffer at this point.  Useful for distinguishing
#               commands and function calls in some languages 'write 7' is a command
#               'write (' is a function call- hold lets us stop at the space and delay
#               the string lookup until the ( or 7.
#
#   The format of the string list is:
#
#      "string"   <target-state> [<options>s]
#      "string"   <target-state> [<options>s]
#      "&"        <target-state> [<options>s]   # matches contents of delimiter match buffer
#      done
#
#   (all of the options above are allowed except "strings", "istrings" and "noeat".  noeat is
#    always implied after a matched string).
#
# Weirdness: only states have colors, not transitions.  This means that you
# sometimes have to make dummy states with '* next-state noeat' just to get
# a color specification.
#
# Delimiter match buffer is for perl and shell: a regex in perl can be s<..>(...)
# and in shell you can say: <<EOS ....... EOS

# New feature: subroutines

# Highlighter state machines can now make subroutine calls.  This works by
# template instantiation: the called state machine is included in your
# current state machine, but is modified so that the return address points
# to the called.  There is still no run-time stack (the state is represented
# as a single integer plus the saved delimiter string).

# Recursion is allowed, but is self limited to 5 levels.

# To call a subroutine, use the 'call' option:
#
#	"\""	fred	call=string(dquote)
#
# The subroutine called 'string' is called and the jump to 'fred' is
# ignored.  The 'dquote' option is passed to the subroutine.
#
# The subroutine itself returns to the caller like this:
#       "\""	whatever  return
#
# If we're in a subroutine, the return is made.  Otherwise the jump
# to 'whatever' is made.
#
# There are several ways of delimiting subroutines which show up in how it
# is called.  Here are the options:
#
# call=string()		  A file called string.jsf is the subroutine.
#                         The entire file is the subroutine.  The starting
#                         point is the first state in the file.
#
# call=library.string()	  A file called library.jsf has the subroutine.
#                         The subroutine within the file is called string.
#
# call=.string()          There is a subroutine called string in the current file.
#
# When a subroutine is within a file, but is not the whole file, it is delimited
# as follows:
#
#  .subr string
#
#  . . . states for string subroutine . . .
#
#  .end
#
# Option flags can be passed to subroutines which control preprocessor-like
# directives.  For example:
#
# .ifdef dquote
#    "\""	idle	return
# .endif
# .ifdef squote
#    "'"	idle 	return
# .endif
#
# .else if also available.  .ifdefs can be nested.


# Obsolete feature: the sync lines specification no longer matter.  We now always parse
# from the beginning of the file.  Here is the old description:
#
# Define no. sync lines
# You can say:
# -200     means 200 lines
# -        means always start parsing from beginning of file when we lose sync
#          if nothing is specified, the default is -50
-

# Define colors and attributes.  Give a list of attributes, one
# background color and one foreground color (default is used if
# color is left out).
#
# Attributes:
#   bold inverse blink dim underline
#
# Standard colors:
#
# Foreground:
#   white cyan magenta blue yellow green red black
#
# Background:
#   bg_white bg_cyan bg_magenta bg_blue bg_yellow bg_green bg_red bg_black
#
# For 16 color and 256 color xterms: "export TERM=xterm-16color", these
# brighter than normal colors are available:
#
# Note that you need an xterm which was compiled to support 16 or 256 colors
# and a matching termcap/terminfo entry for it.
#
# Foreground:
#   WHITE CYAN MAGENTA BLUE YELLOW GREEN RED BLACK
#
# Background:
#   bg_WHITE bg_CYAN bg_MAGENTA bg_BLUE bg_YELLOW bg_GREEN bg_RED bg_BLACK
#
# For 256 color xterm: "export TERM=xterm-256color", these become available:
#
# Note that you need an xterm which was compiled to support 256 colors and a
# matching termcap/terminfo entry for it.
#
# fg_RGB and bg_RGB, where R, G, and B range from 0 - 5.  So: fg_500 is bright red.
#
# fg_NN and bg_NN give shades of grey, where the intensity, NN, ranges from 0 - 23.
