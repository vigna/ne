# Comments and blank lines are allowed, or any line that doesn't match:
#  ^\s*(\w+)\s*([0-9]*)\s*(.+)
#  ^\s*(\w+)\s+([0-9]+i?)\s+(.+[^ \t])\s*$
# Canonical format: <file> <n>[i] <regex>
# Space delimited; when <regex> matches the first <n> lines, <file>.jsf applies.
# "i" suffix on <n> makes search case-insensitive.

# These patterns match some common command interpreters in the first line:
csh   1   ^#!\s*/.*(csh|tcsh)\b\s*
sh    1   ^#!\s*/.*sh\b\s*
pl    1   ^#!\s*/.*perl\b\s*
py    1   ^#!\s*/.*python[0-9]*\b\s*
rb    1   ^#!\s*/.*ruby\b\s*
xml   1   ^\s*<\?xml\b

# These must match in the first 30 and 20 lines respectively to work.
yaml 30   ^---$
ini  20   ^\[\s*\w+\s*\]$

# By default ne does not override a file's given extension. However,
# you can specify any number of extensions that you would like to
# allow to be overridden by including lines in your ~/.ne/extensions
# containing only a dot followed by a single extension or shell "glob
# pattern". (Basically if "ls *.pat" matches, then put ".pat" on a
# line by itself in your ~/.ne/.extensions file. Note that ".*" would
# allow overriding all extensions.
#
# Don't put such extensions in this global file, as then individual
# users cannot choose whether to allow overriding such files.
